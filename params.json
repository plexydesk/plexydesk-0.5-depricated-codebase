{"name":"Plexydesk","tagline":"A Qt Desktop customizer.","body":"Getting PlexyDesk source files:\r\n===============================\r\nYou can get PlexyDesk sources via two methods:\r\n\r\nMETHOD 1:\r\n---------\r\n1. Go to a folder of your choice where you will build PlexyDesk.\r\n   For example /tmp/plexy\r\n2. git clone git@github.com:plexydesk/plexydesk.git\r\n3. cd plexydesk\r\n\r\nMETHOD 2:\r\n---------\r\n1. Go to a folder of your choice where you will build PlexyDesk.\r\n   For example /tmp/plexy\r\n2. Get the source tarball from our download page - http://www.plexyplanet.org/download#source\r\n3. tar xjvf plexydesk-X.X.X.tar.bz2\r\n   where X.X.X is the version number of PlexyDesk\r\n4. cd plexydesk-X.X.X\r\n   where X.X.X is the version number of PlexyDesk\r\n\r\nBoth methods will lead you in the sources root folder.\r\nNext continue with building depending on what you are after.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Have in mind that the best way to install PlexyDesk is using your distribution\r\n      native package system. PlexyDesk now supports building packages for these\r\n      distributions (see howto do it below):\r\n      - Mandriva\r\n      - openSuSE\r\n      - Fedora\r\n      - PCLinuxOS*\r\n      - Ubuntu\r\n      - Debian and its derivatives\r\n\r\nPCLinuxOS support for building its native packages is dropped now (though the code\r\nthat supports the rpm build will remain intact). At present PlexyDesk is known to\r\nbuild and work on the 2011.6 version of pclos.\r\nTo find more info on the possible solutions you have, please visit our homepage:\r\nhttp://www.plexyplanet.org/pclos\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding On Linux (debug mode):\r\n===============================\r\nThis is valid for all distributions.\r\nFrom sources root folder do:\r\n\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\ncmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:STRING=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=true -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG:STRING=\"-g -O0\"\r\nmake\r\nsudo make install\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding On Linux (release mode):\r\n=================================\r\nThis is valid for all distributions.\r\nFrom sources root folder do:\r\n\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\ncmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\r\nmake\r\nsudo make install\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding a Debian/Ubuntu package on Linux:\r\n==========================================\r\nThis can be done if your distribution is a Debian derivative.\r\nFrom sources root folder do:\r\n\r\ndist/make_dist_deb.sh\r\n\r\nand follow the instructions.\r\nWhen the plexydesk_X.X.X_YYYY.deb is ready you may install it using the deb standard\r\ncommand:\r\n\r\ndpkg -i INSTALLERS/deb/plexydesk_X.X.X_YYYY.deb\r\n\r\nNOTE: If some of the dependencies are not satisfied, use your package manager to install\r\nthem first and then do the \"dpkg -i plexydesk_X.X.X_YYYY.deb\" again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding an RPM package on Linux:\r\n=================================\r\nThis can be done if your distribution is an RPM distribution. Currently PlexyDesk\r\nsupports building RPMs for these distributions:\r\n  - Mandriva\r\n  - openSuSE\r\n  - Fedora\r\n  - Ubuntu\r\n  - Debian and its derivatives\r\n\r\nIf you know for sure that your distribution is an RPM one, but it is not in the above\r\nlist, please try this method first and it may work due to the included support\r\neven of unknown RPM distros.\r\n\r\nFirst be sure you have already installed the rpm-build package.\r\nNext from sources root folder do:\r\n\r\ndist/make_dist_rpm.sh\r\n\r\nand follow the instructions.\r\nWhen the plexydesk-X.X.X-YYYYYYY.rpm is ready you may install it using the rpm standard\r\ncommand:\r\n\r\nrpm -ivp INSTALLERS/rpm/plexydesk-X.X.X-YYYYYYY.rpm\r\n\r\nNOTE: If some of the dependencies are not satisfied, use your package manager to install\r\nthem first and then do the \"rpm -ivp plexydesk-X.X.X-YYYYYYY.rpm\" again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding On Windows:\r\n====================\r\nPlease follow the instructions on http://www.plexyplanet.org/win_build\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding On Blackberry 10 SDK:\r\n==============================\r\n\r\nYou need to download the blackberry 10 NDK from the blackberry developer portal. (currently this is free).\r\nafter insalling the SDK excute the following commands to compile plexydesk for blackberry 10.\r\n\r\n- source ~/bbndk/bbndk-env.sh\r\n- cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../tools/Toolchain-QNX-6.4.1.cmake -DCMAKE_INSALL_PREFIX=~/bbroot/plexydesk\r\n- make -j 8\r\n- make install : when the install finishes you will find the compiled binaries in ~/bbroot/plexydesk\r\n- now you can create a bar file and upload it to your devce.\r\n\r\n\r\nDebugging of PlexyDesk\r\n======================\r\nIf you need a debug output from PlexyDesk, you have two methods:\r\n\r\nMETHOD 1:\r\n---------\r\nPlexyDesk if built in Debugging Mode, will create a log file in your temp folder\r\n(depending on your platform) that will be named plexydesk_log_DATE-TIME.txt\r\nYou can see the output in this file.\r\n\r\nMETHOD 2:\r\n---------\r\nYou may debug PlexyDesk (only if built in Debugging Mode) by starting it in console\r\n(any platform) and using the environment variable: PLEXYDESK_CONSOLE_DEBUG.\r\nSet it to \"enable\", \"true\" or 1 (all are case insensitive). For Windows for example\r\ndo it by issuing this command on the command line of your Command prompt:\r\nSET PLEXYDESK_CONSOLE_DEBUG=true\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
